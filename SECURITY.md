### Security Considerations

The TdLib Universal Installer performs the following potentially sensitive operations:

- **System package installation** (requires sudo privileges)
- **File system modifications** (creates directories and files)
- **Network requests** (downloads source code from GitHub)
- **Compilation** (executes build tools)

### Best Practices for Users

1. **Review the script** before running it on your system
2. **Run in a controlled environment** (VM or container) for testing
3. **Keep your system updated** with latest security patches
4. **Use official sources** only - download from the official repository

### Scope

This security policy covers:

- The main installation script (`install.sh`)
- Documentation and examples
- GitHub Actions workflows
- Any auxiliary scripts or tools

### Out of Scope

- Third-party dependencies (TdLib itself, system packages)
